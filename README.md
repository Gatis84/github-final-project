# 🎉 **Simple Interest Calculator** 💰

Welcome to the **Simple Interest Calculator**! 🎉 This easy-to-use tool helps you calculate the **simple interest** based on the principal amount 💵, the annual interest rate 📊, and the time period in years 🕰️. Whether you're a finance student, an investor, or just curious, this calculator will give you a quick and accurate result! 🚀

## 🧮 **How It Works**

The **Simple Interest** formula is:

$$
\text{Simple Interest} = \frac{{P \times R \times T}}{{100}}
$$

Where:

* **P** is the **Principal** amount (the initial sum of money 💰).
* **R** is the **Annual Rate of Interest** (in percentage 📊).
* **T** is the **Time Period** (in years 🕰️).

The program takes these inputs and calculates the **Simple Interest** for you. 💡

---

## 🚀 **Features**

* **⚡ Fast and Accurate**: Instantly calculates the simple interest based on your inputs.
* **🔧 Easy to Use**: Just input the principal amount, rate, and time, and the result is displayed right away.
* **📊 Clear Output**: Get your simple interest in an easy-to-understand format.

## 🔑 **Inputs**

To use the calculator, you'll need to provide these values:

* **Principal (P)**: The initial amount of money you're investing or borrowing 💸.
* **Time (T)**: The duration (in years 🕰️) for which the interest is calculated.
* **Rate (R)**: The **annual interest rate** (expressed as a percentage %).

---

## 🎯 **Example:**

### **Input:**

* **Principal (P)** = \$1,000 💵
* **Rate of Interest (R)** = 5% 📈
* **Time Period (T)** = 3 years 🕰️

### **Calculation:**

$$
\text{Simple Interest} = \frac{{1000 \times 5 \times 3}}{{100}} = 150
$$

### **Output:**

* **Simple Interest** = \$150 💰
